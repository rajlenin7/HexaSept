git add . {files will be added to the staging area}

3) local repository : Once you finalized the changes succesfully, then you need to commit the file to the local repository. Once its added to the local repository, then you can push the changes to remote.  (Once it is in local repository, you never get updates in remote)


git commit -m "message" {if you dont give message, it opens in vi editor and prompts you to enter message}

4) remote repository : Once you push the files to remote repository, then the files will be available to all remote users. 

git push origin master {master is the branch_name}
